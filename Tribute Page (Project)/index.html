          Nelson Mandela was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary,
          political leader, and philanthropist who served as President of South
          Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of
          state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic
          election.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mandela's presidency marked the end of decades of institutionalized
          racial segregation and discrimination in South Africa, and he is
          celebrated for his role in promoting peace, reconciliation, and social
          justice.

        <h2>Famous Quote</h2>
        <blockquote>
          "I have walked that long road to freedom. I have tried not to falter;
          I have made missteps along the way. But I have discovered the secret
          that after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many
          more hills to climb. I have taken a moment here to rest, to steal a
          view of the glorious vista that surrounds me, to look back on the
          distance I have come. But I can only rest for a moment, for with
          freedom comes responsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my long
          walk is not ended."
